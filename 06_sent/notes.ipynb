      "but after watching this inane exercise of a movie , i certainly feel that i've miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond . \n",
      "oddly , `eye of the beholder , ' which is a psychological-romance-thriller , starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent , called the eye ( ewan mcgregor ) , working in washington dc . \n",
      "in the humorous opening scene , he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down . \n",
      "using an array of high-tech surveillance and communications equipment , he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office . \n",

      "after each killing , she puts on a different wig , assumes a new name , and then makes her way to another state . \n",
      "the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions . \n",
