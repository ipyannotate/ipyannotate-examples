      " \" scream 3 \" provides the latest proof of this rule . \n",
      "in los angeles production has begun on \" stab 3 : return to woodsboro , \" the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) . \n",
      "however , life soon starts imitating art , and \" stab \" cast members turn up stabbed . \n",
      "smelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in \" stab 3 . \" elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name . \n",

      "the late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy . \n",
      "he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with . \n",
      "indeed , \" scream 3 \" tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney's mother maureen before the beginning of the original \" scream . \" \n",
      "at the scene of each murder in \" scream 3 , \" the killer leaves a photo of sidney's mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer . \n",
      "to find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen's missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films . \n",
      " ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer's relationship to sidney is ) . \n",
      "unlike its predecessors , \" scream 3 \" doesn't have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer . \n",

      "wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret , so it's quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen . \n",
      "the series' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious . \n",
      "possibly it's the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson , who penned the first two , or maybe it's that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche . \n",
      "i groaned as an attack on sidney from the first \" scream \" was repeated moment-for-moment in the hollywood set of her home . \n",
      "at some point , referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas . \n",
      " \" scream 3 \" also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles . \n",
      "look for jenny mccarthy , carrie fisher , patrick warburton ( puddy from \" seinfeld \" ) , roger corman , and jason mewes and kevin smith ( as jay and silent bob ) to walk through at some point . \n",
      "all these bit players put forth more effort than the series' returning stars , who are probably saving their energy for the long post- \" scream \" job search . \n",
      "another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies are copying \" the blair witch project \" 's web strategy . \n",
      " \" scream 3 \" has three official websites that ( wink , wink ) pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie . \n",

      "craven and company promise that this is the last installment in the \" scream \" series . \n",
      "while i hope that's true , i don't hold out much hope-horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters . \n",
      "there's a \" halloween h2k \" in the works , even though michael myers was beheaded in \" h20 , \" and a \" freddy vs . jason \" has been talked about for awhile , despite the fact that both characters were \" killed off . \" \n",
