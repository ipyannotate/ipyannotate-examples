      "now , alex , and fellow survivors , who consist of friend clear waters ( ali larter ) , enemy carter ( kerr smith ) , carter's girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the goofy billy ( sean william scott ) and his brother tod ( chad donella ) , and teacher , ms . valerie lewton ( kristen cloke ) , are in extreme danger , as it seems they have cheated death by getting off of that plane , and now death wants them . \n",

      "the characters have multi-dimensional personalities for a change , and for the most part , you highly sympathize with them once death starts to come their way . \n",
      "devon sawa and ali larter are the main focus of the film , and both actors follow up their well written characters with even better performances , that , like the \" scream \" movies did for their cast , will launch them into superstardom . \n",
